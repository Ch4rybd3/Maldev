  WannaSwim is my own version of Wannacry, It has a working killswitch which is actually harder to detect because the URL is randomly generated and it double check using a connexion to google.com.
  If the workstation can connect to a random URL or can't connect to google.com, it means that it's running in a sandbox and shut itself down to prevent analysis.
  It encrypt data in a specific folder, if it does not find this folder, it shut itself down to prevent unwanted damages.
  It encrypt the files using AES, and then encrypt it using RSA and send the key to a C2 with some metadata to be able to identify which key goes to which workstation.
  It's not very discreet, but for some reasons, SentinelOne does not seems to see it acting weird.
